/* LeetCode 172: Factorial Trailing Zeroes

Problem Description:
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n! (n factorial).

A trailing zero is produced by the factors 10 = 2 Ã— 5.
In any factorial, there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of trailing zeroes depends only on the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. */
